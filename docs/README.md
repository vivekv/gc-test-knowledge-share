# OctoAcme Project Management Process Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation hub. This guide provides an overview of our project management approach and links to detailed process documents.

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management processes are structured to provide clarity, collaboration, and accountability throughout the project lifecycle. Projects begin with a clear initiation phase, where the business need, stakeholders, success metrics, and a high-level timeline are captured in a project one-pager. This artifact serves as the touchstone for alignment, followed by a robust planning stage. During planning, deliverables are broken down into prioritized backlogs with defined acceptance criteria, estimates, and owners, ensuring transparency and a shared understanding of scope and objectives.

The execution and tracking workflow leverages a visual project board with states such as Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, and Done, enabling seamless tracking of work items and handoffs between team members. OctoAcme champions small, reviewable pull requests tied to specific issues and acceptance criteria, reinforcing traceability and manageable change sets. Strict branching and pull request conventions, coupled with automated CI for tests and linting, underscore the commitment to engineering rigor. Team rhythm is maintained through daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, sprint demos, and regular reporting—providing an ongoing forum to surface blockers, review progress, and flag risks early.

Personas and roles within OctoAcme are carefully delineated to ensure comprehensive coverage of all project needs. Product Managers own the outcome and vision, prioritize the backlog, and drive user-centric decisions using data. Project Managers coordinate delivery, risk, dependencies, and facilitate communication across all stakeholders. UX Designers ensure intuitive and accessible user experiences through research and design. Scrum Masters facilitate agile ceremonies and remove impediments to optimize team flow. DevOps Engineers build robust infrastructure and deployment pipelines for reliable delivery. Business Analysts bridge business requirements with technical implementation. Developers focus on implementation, code quality, and helping scope work, while QA ensures acceptance criteria and overall quality. These roles converge through documented rituals like sprint planning, retrospectives, and stakeholder updates, with a strong emphasis on psychological safety and continuous improvement.

Quality assurance (QA) is integrated throughout the workflow. It encompasses unit, integration, and end-to-end testing, manual QA for major features, and security scanning before releases. Each release goes through defined pre-release checks, well-documented deployment and rollback processes, and is communicated to stakeholders through structured release notes. After each milestone, retrospective meetings capture what worked and what can be improved, turning learnings into actionable improvements tracked within the regular project backlog and risk registers. Clear communication templates, escalation paths, and stakeholder engagement routines support OctoAcme's commitment to consistency, visibility, and delivery excellence.

4. Use the [Persona Onboarding Checklist](./octoacme-persona-onboarding-checklist.md) for role-specific onboarding guidance
5. Familiarize yourself with the phase-specific documents relevant to your current work:
   - Starting a new project? See [Project Initiation](./octoacme-project-initiation.md)
   - Planning an upcoming sprint? See [Project Planning](./octoacme-project-planning.md)
   - In active development? See [Execution & Tracking](./octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md)

### For Project Leads

- Keep the [Risk Management & Communication](./octoacme-risks-and-communication.md) guide handy for stakeholder updates and risk tracking
- Reference [Release & Deployment](./octoacme-release-and-deployment.md) when preparing for production releases
- Schedule regular retrospectives using the [Retrospective & Continuous Improvement](./octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md) framework

## Key Principles

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in all decisions
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments frequently
- **Clear ownership**: Every project has named owners and clear accountability
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback, learning, and continuous improvement

## Questions or Feedback?

If you have questions about these processes or suggestions for improvement, please reach out to your Project Manager or Product Lead. We continuously refine our approach based on team feedback and learnings from retrospectives.
